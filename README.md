# Luxe

A monorepo for [the trifecta](./TRIFECTA.md) of organizations - Neon Law, Neon Law Foundation, and Sagebrush Services.
Another small business, Hoshi Hoshi, creators of Destined Travel, an astrocartography travel website, is included herein
because it has the same engineering team that develops applications using Swift Server.

Luxe is a play on lux, Latin for light, and luxurious, an homage to our founding city of Las Vegas, Nevada.

## Getting Started

Luxe is built by developers who are comfortable with macOS, Swift, containers, and git.

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Install the latest macOS and Xcode
2. Install Docker Desktop
3. Run the unified setup script:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-development-environment.sh
   ```

This script will automatically:

- Install Homebrew and all required dependencies
- Set up git hooks (if configured)
- Start Docker services (PostgreSQL, Dex, LocalStack)
- Configure Dex with static users and luxe-client
- Run database migrations
- Verify your installation

### Testing Your Setup

After setup, test authentication by:

1. Starting a web target: `swift run Bazaar`
2. Navigate to: <http://localhost:8080/app/me>
3. Login with: `admin@neonlaw.com / Vegas702!` from the redirected Dex login page.

### Local Development Authentication

The DevelopmentAuthMiddleware provides an easy way to test different authentication scenarios during local development without external dependencies.

#### Quick Auth Testing

Add `?auth=admin|staff|customer|none` to any URL to switch authentication modes:

```bash
# Admin authentication
curl http://localhost:8080/app/me?auth=admin

# Staff authentication  
curl http://localhost:8080/app/me?auth=staff

# Customer authentication
curl http://localhost:8080/app/me?auth=customer

# No authentication
curl http://localhost:8080/app/me?auth=none
```

#### Automatic Route Detection

The middleware automatically selects appropriate authentication based on route patterns:

- `/admin/*` ‚Üí Admin role
- `/staff/*`, `/reports/*` ‚Üí Staff role  
- `/app/*`, `/api/*` ‚Üí Customer role
- All other routes ‚Üí Public (no auth)

#### Mock Users

The middleware automatically creates these development users:

| Role     | Username                    | Groups                               |
|----------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Admin    | dev-admin@neonlaw.com      | admin, administrators, staff, users  |
| Staff    | dev-staff@neonlaw.com      | staff, employees, users              |
| Customer | dev-customer@example.com   | users, customers                     |

#### Environment Variables

Set default authentication via environment variables:

```bash
# Set default auth mode
DEV_AUTH_MODE=admin swift run Bazaar

# Use custom username
DEV_AUTH_USER=custom@example.com swift run Bazaar
```

#### Debug Headers

The middleware adds helpful debug headers to responses:

- `x-dev-auth-processed`: Middleware processed the request
- `x-dev-auth-mode`: Auth mode used
- `x-dev-auth-user`: Authenticated username
- `x-dev-auth-role`: User's role
- `x-dev-auth-hint`: Usage hints

**Note:** This middleware only runs in development and testing environments. Production uses real AWS ALB headers.

## Claude Code Development

We encourage developing this repository using **Claude Code**. This project follows a strict
**roadmap-driven development** approach with Test-Driven Development (TDD) and quality-first principles.

### Development Philosophy

```text
üó∫Ô∏è  Roadmap-Driven Development
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìã All work starts with roadmaps (never code directly)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üß™ Test-Driven Development with Swift Testing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üéØ Quality gates at every step (swift test)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ü§ñ Claude Code automation for consistent execution
```

**Always reference CLAUDE.md** - it contains comprehensive guidelines, shortcuts, and quality standards. The more you
*explore CLAUDE.md, the more productive you'll become with this codebase.
