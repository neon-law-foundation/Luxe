# Neon Law, Neon Law Foundation, Sagebrush Services

Luxe is written for a trifecta of companies that share many of the same staff and customers. However, each company has
its own unique role.

## Neon Law

Neon Law is currently the law firm Shook Law PLLC in Nevada. Neon Law only sells bespoke legal services tailored to the
needs of our clients. We choose matters that align with our mission to increase love and respect. Because Neon Law is a
law firm only lawyers can participate in profit sharing.

## Neon Law Foundation

Neon Law Foundation is a 501(c)(3) non-profit. Our main deliverables are this OSS repository, Luxe, other open-source
software development work to maintain our systems in perpetuity, and most importantly, building a community of people
who believe in inclusion, privacy, and creating standards to advance access to justice.

## Sagebrush Services

Sagebrush Services is a Nevada corporation. Our goal is to be a trusted partner for all the boring but necessary tasks
including:

- Mailroom: Send your mail here and we will scan it and upload it to our portal.
- Entity Management: File and renew your Nevada and federal forms on time.
- Cap Tables: Manage how to share the pie with teammates, advisors, and investors.
- Personal Data: Protect your privacy by tracking who requests and retains your information.

## How the trifecta works

This repository is licensed from Neon Law Foundation, the act of writing software is also governed by the Foundation.

The operations of running the software are managed by Sagebrush Services. Continuous integration is NLF and continuous
deployment is Sagebrush Services.

Sagebrush Services is where all non-legal-service work is billed from. Neon Law is where legal advice is billed from,
such as contract review, estate plan creation, and bespoke litigation.

Sagebrush Services and Neon Law pledge 10% of gross revenue to the Neon Law Foundation. Any other software built in this
repository comes from other entities who also pledge 10% of gross revenue to the Neon Law Foundation.

Each entity has its own accounting ledger and bank accounts.
