            You are reviewing a pull request for the Luxe project, a full-stack Swift monorepo.
            
            Please perform a comprehensive code review focusing on:
            
            1. **Swift Best Practices**
               - Protocol-oriented design principles
               - Proper use of value types vs reference types
               - Swift concurrency (async/await, actors)
               - Optional handling and nil-coalescing
            
            2. **Project Standards (from CLAUDE.md)**
               - Swift-only code (except SQL/Markdown)
               - Vapor framework for server-side
               - Swift Testing framework (never XCTest)
               - Dependency injection patterns
               - Service layer architecture
            
            3. **Code Quality**
               - Clean, readable code
               - Proper error handling
               - No compiler warnings
               - Cross-platform compatibility (macOS and Linux)
               - Memory safety and performance
            
            4. **Security Considerations**
               - OAuth2/OIDC implementation
               - JWT validation
               - SQL injection prevention
               - Input validation
               - Secrets management
            
            5. **Testing**
               - Test coverage for new functionality
               - Use of Swift Testing framework
               - Mock implementations for dependencies
               - Edge case handling
            
            6. **Database & API**
               - Migration safety (never modify existing)
               - OpenAPI specification compliance
               - RESTful design principles
               - Proper HTTP status codes
            
            Please provide:
            - A summary of the changes
            - Specific issues that must be addressed
            - Suggestions for improvements
            - Positive feedback on well-implemented features
            
            Be constructive and educational in your feedback.
