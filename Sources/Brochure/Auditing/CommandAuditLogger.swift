/// Command audit logging wrapper that integrates audit logging with CLI command execution.
///
/// `CommandAuditLogger` provides a convenient wrapper around `AuditLogger` specifically designed
/// for CLI command execution scenarios. It automatically captures command context, timing,
/// and outcomes for comprehensive audit trails.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **Automatic Context Capture**: Captures command name, arguments, and execution environment
/// - **Timing Measurement**: Tracks command execution duration for performance monitoring
/// - **Error Handling**: Captures and logs command failures with detailed error information
/// - **User Context**: Records the system user executing commands for security tracking
/// - **Environment Sanitization**: Safely logs relevant environment variables without credentials
///
/// ## Usage Examples
///
/// ```swift
/// // Basic command audit logging
/// let commandLogger = CommandAuditLogger()
///
/// try await commandLogger.auditCommand(
///     command: "upload",
///     arguments: ["--profile", "production", "NeonLaw"]
/// ) {
///     // Execute the actual command
///     try await performUpload()
/// }
///
/// // With custom environment context
/// try await commandLogger.auditCommandWithContext(
///     command: "bootstrap",
///     arguments: ["--template", "landing-page", "MyProject"],
///     environment: ["DEPLOYMENT_ENV": "production"]
/// ) {
///     try await createBootstrapProject()
/// }
/// ```
