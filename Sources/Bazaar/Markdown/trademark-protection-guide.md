rights to use your brand, prevents competitors from copying your identity, and builds long-term value for your
company.

Many businesses operate across multiple categories. For example, a technology company might need protection in:

* Class 9 (software and computer hardware)

* Class 42 (technological services and software development)

Each class requires separate filing fees and provides distinct protection for different aspects of your business.

USPTO base filing fees start at $350 per class, but comprehensive trademark registration requires legal
expertise to navigate the complex application process, conduct thorough searches, and respond to office
actions.
