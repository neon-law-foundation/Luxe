We're excited to announce that Sagebrush Services is searching for an exceptional Chief Executive
Officer to lead our company into its next phase of growth and innovation.

## The Opportunity

Sagebrush Services has established itself as a trusted provider of comprehensive business services,
from virtual mailbox solutions to corporate formation and legal support. We're now seeking a visionary
leader who can expand our impact and drive our mission forward with both strategic insight and
operational excellence.

## The Ideal Candidate

We're looking for someone with a unique combination of legal expertise and entrepreneurial vision.
The ideal candidate will be either a practicing lawyer or someone with substantial startup law experience
who understands the complexities and opportunities within the legal services landscape. This background
is essential because our CEO will need to navigate regulatory requirements, understand client needs,
and identify growth opportunities that align with legal industry standards and innovations.

## What You'll Be Doing

As CEO of Sagebrush Services, you'll be responsible for building and implementing a comprehensive
roadmap that spans our diverse service offerings including virtual mailbox solutions, coworking leases,
cap table management, corporate formation services, estate planning, and the exciting new opportunities
that emerge at the intersection of law and technology. Your role will also involve actively engaging
with our advisors and ensuring their satisfaction and happiness, because we believe that great advisors
are essential partners in creating exceptional products and services that truly serve our clients.
The successful candidate will work closely with our team to identify market opportunities, develop
strategic partnerships, and ensure that every aspect of our business reflects our commitment to
excellence and innovation.

## Why Sagebrush Services

At Sagebrush Services, we've built a culture that values smart decision-making, open communication,
and the kind of thoughtful innovation that makes a real difference in our clients' lives. We're not
just another legal services companyâ€”we're building something meaningful that helps entrepreneurs,
businesses, and individuals navigate complex legal and administrative challenges with confidence and ease.

Our team believes in the power of technology to enhance, not replace, the human elements of legal
and business services. We're looking for a CEO who shares this vision and can help us continue to grow
while maintaining the personal touch and attention to detail that our clients have come to expect.

## Ready to Lead?

If you're passionate about the intersection of law, technology, and business services, and you're
ready to take on the challenge of leading a growing company with tremendous potential, we'd love to
hear from you.

Please send your resume, a cover letter explaining why you're interested in this opportunity,
and any relevant information about your background and vision to [support@sagebrush.services](mailto:support@sagebrush.services).

We're excited to meet the leader who will help write the next chapter of Sagebrush Services' story.
