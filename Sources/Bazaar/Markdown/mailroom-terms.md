## Sagebrush Services, LLC

If you have an active Sagebrush Services account, these are the terms and conditions for the mailroom service provided
by Sagebrush Services, LLC.

## 1. Service Authorization and Mail Pickup Requirements

By signing up for Sagebrush Services and submitting a USPS Form 1583, which will be made available to the United States
Postal Service, Applicant appoints Mail Service as Agent for the receipt of mail and packages from common carriers as
defined by Mail Service for a period not to exceed that for which rent has been paid in advance.

Applicants will pick up mail at least once each week (or more often if needed to ensure that mailbox will not be
overfull) or make other suitable arrangements, in advance, with Mail Service. Mail Service may provide a lockbox key to
applicant who may obtain their mail during the business hours posted by Mail Service. Should Applicant appoint another
person or organization, authorization will only be granted when written authorization is received by the mail service
renter.

## 2. Mail Volume Limitations and Additional Fees

**Base Service Coverage:** The standard mailbox rental fee covers:
- Government mail (federal, state, and local correspondence)
- Up to three (3) personal/business letters per month
- Standard USPS mail meeting these volume limitations

**Additional Billing:**
- Mail volume exceeding three (3) non-government letters per month will incur additional handling fees of $5.00 per
  additional piece

  12"x12"x12") and $25.00 for oversized packages

and Mail Service shall not be responsible for loss, theft, or damage. Mail Service is not engaged in the delivery of
mail and cannot be responsible for failure of the United States Postal Service or other carriers to deliver mail or
parcels in a timely fashion or undamaged condition.

## 4. Compliance and Confidentiality

Applicant agrees to use services in accordance with Mail Service rules and in compliance with all U.S. Postal
regulations, as well as local, state, and federal statutes and regulations. Failure to do so may result in immediate
cancellation of service without notice, refund, or mail forwarding.

Information provided by Applicant will be kept confidential and will not knowingly be disclosed without Applicant's
prior consent, except for law enforcement or postal operations purposes, in which case Mail Service intends to cooperate
fully. Law enforcement includes all city, county, state, or federal agencies or their representatives. Legal Service
