When building a startup, one of your most critical decisions involves structuring equity compensation for employees.
The industry standard—a four-year vesting schedule with a one-year cliff—has become ubiquitous for good reason. Let's
explore why this structure protects both founders and companies, and how Sagebrush can help you implement it seamlessly
from our Reno headquarters.

## Understanding the One-Year Cliff

A one-year cliff means employees receive no equity until their first work anniversary. On that date, they vest 25% of
their total grant immediately. After the cliff, they typically vest the remaining 75% monthly over the next three years,
receiving 1/48th of their total grant each month.

This structure has become the gold standard, with 62% of European tech companies and the vast majority of U.S. startups
adopting this approach. As noted by industry experts at Investopedia and Carta, this consistency helps set clear
expectations across the startup ecosystem.

## Why the One-Year Cliff Protects Your Company

### 1. **Trial Period for Cultural Fit**

The cliff serves as an extended evaluation period. As startup advisors at goodcounsel explain, "The standard
justification for a cliff is that it gives the company the opportunity to assess whether the equity recipient is a
'keeper.'" This protects your cap table from being diluted by employees who aren't the right long-term fit.

### 2. **Preventing Early Departures with Equity**

Without a cliff, an employee who leaves after three months would still own equity in your company. FasterCapital notes
that cliffs prevent "people from leaving the startup early and taking a large chunk of equity with them, which could
dilute the value of the remaining shares and demotivate the other team members."

### 3. **Aligning Long-Term Incentives**

The one-year commitment encourages employees to think beyond short-term gains. As GlobalShares observes, "Many companies
offer option grants with a one-year cliff to motivate employees to stay for at least a year," creating alignment between
individual success and company growth.

### 4. **Industry Standard Expectations**

Following the standard structure simplifies hiring and negotiations. Employees familiar with startup compensation expect
this model, making your offers easier to understand and compare. Deviating from the norm often raises questions and can
complicate recruiting efforts.

## Implementing Cliffs Fairly

While cliffs protect companies, they must be implemented ethically. Legal experts warn against terminating employees
just before their cliff date, calling it "bad faith" and potentially actionable. Some companies implement protections
where employees terminated without cause near their cliff date receive partial vesting—balancing company protection with
fairness.

## Why Nevada and Reno Are Ideal for Your Equity Plans

Nevada's business-friendly environment makes it the perfect home for your company's equity management. The state offers
remarkable advantages that align with what business owners want:

### **Tax Benefits That Matter**

Nevada imposes no corporate income tax, personal income tax, franchise tax, or inventory tax. As the Governor's Office
of Economic Development notes, these policies ensure your equity compensation isn't eroded by state taxes—maximizing
value for both your company and employees.

### **Privacy and Asset Protection**

Nevada law provides stringent liability protections for shareholders and robust privacy safeguards. Business owners can
maintain confidentiality in corporate records, and the state's dedicated business court system efficiently handles any
disputes that arise—crucial when managing complex equity structures.

### **Business-Friendly Legal Framework**

Perhaps most importantly, Nevada's legal system consistently prioritizes what business owners want. The state
legislature has created laws that protect company assets, simplify corporate governance, and minimize regulatory burden.
This pro-business stance extends to equity compensation, making it easier to implement and manage employee stock plans.

### **Reno's Growing Tech Ecosystem**

Reno's expanding tech sector, supported by programs from the Economic Development Authority of Western Nevada (EDAWN)
and the University of Nevada, Reno's Office of Enterprise & Innovation, creates an ideal environment for startups. The
city combines Nevada's business advantages with a growing talent pool and lower costs than coastal tech hubs.
