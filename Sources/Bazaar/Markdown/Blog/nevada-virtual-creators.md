## Why Nevada is Perfect for Virtual Creators

### The ultimate guide for influencers, content creators, and digital entrepreneurs

> **Key Takeaway:** If you're making money virtually through Instagram, TikTok, OnlyFans, or other digital
> platforms, Nevada offers unbeatable tax advantages and business-friendly laws. However, if you host
> in-person events regularly in another state (like California), you may need to consider incorporating where
> those activities occur.

## Why Virtual Creators Love Nevada

### 1. No State Income Tax

Nevada has no state income tax on individuals or businesses. For creators earning six or seven figures from
digital platforms, this can mean tens of thousands in annual savings compared to high-tax states like California
(up to 13.3%) or New York (up to 10.9%).

### 2. Business-Friendly Laws

Nevada offers some of the strongest privacy protections and corporate laws in the nation. Your personal
assets are well-protected, and you can maintain anonymity in your business filings – perfect for creators who
value privacy.

### 3. No Franchise Tax on LLCs

Unlike many states, Nevada doesn't impose annual franchise taxes on LLCs. This keeps your overhead low and
maximizes the money that stays in your pocket.

### 4. Virtual-First Mindset

Nevada recognizes the digital economy. The state's laws are designed for businesses that operate primarily
online, making it ideal for creators who work from anywhere.

## When You Might Need to Consider Other States

⚠️ **In-Person Activities Matter**

If you regularly host in-person events, meetups, or business activities in another state, you may need to
incorporate there instead. For example:

- California creators hosting regular meetups in LA may need a CA LLC

- New York influencers with physical popup stores need NY incorporation

- Texas creators with regular in-person brand partnerships may need TX presence

**Why?** You'll likely have to pay that state's franchise tax anyway due to having a physical presence there.
