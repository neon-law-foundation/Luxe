/// The main Holiday command-line tool for toggling between static holiday pages and active ECS services.
///
/// ## Overview
/// Holiday provides a cost-effective way to switch your infrastructure between active and maintenance modes.
/// During holidays or planned downtime, you can serve static pages from S3 instead of running ECS services.
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```bash
/// swift run Holiday vacation  # Enable holiday mode
/// swift run Holiday work      # Return to normal operations
/// ```

/// 3. Stops all configured ECS services to save costs
